  <p>Hi, everyone!  I'm just now learning HTML!  <em>(Should have done this ages ago!)</em></p>
  <p>Had to at least put my favorite quote on my page!</p>
  <img src="http://www.rcshield.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/quote-courage-is-not-simply-one-of-the-virtues-but-the-form-of-every-virtue-at-the-testing-point-c-s-lewis-111534-e1381524679141.jpg" />
  <p>Phew!  That took 4 trys before I noticed I was typing "scr" (screen?) instead of "src" (source?)!</p>

  <p>Now for my homework:</p>
<div id="hobbies">
    	<h2>Hobbies</h2> 
    <ul>
      <li>Singing:  Favorite is singing harmony, but it's hard to do by yourself!</li>
      <li>Dancing:  East Coast Swing, Rhumba, Line Dancing</li>
      <li>Teaching ESL:  Current student was a teacher in Russia; she's a fast learner!</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="movies">
    <h2>Favorite Movies</h2> 
    <ol>
      <li>Romantic Comedies:<em>Everafter, While You Were Sleeping, Don Juan Demarco, Crossing Delancey, Sixteen Candles</em></li>
      <li>Action:<em>Die Hard, Bourne Identity, Terminator, True Lies, Firefly, Air Force One</em></li>
      <li>Dramas:<em>West Side Story, Places in the Heart, Secondhand Lions, Amazing Grace</em></li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What I Hope to Learn in <em>Front-End Web Development</em> Class </h2>
    <p>I am currently a tech writer, but I've been told via interest surveys and assessment tests that I'd be good at web design.  I've never tried it, but I think it would be a great tool to have for volunteer work.  I'm sure that I could spend the rest of my volunteer time just helping non-profits manage their websites!</p>
    <p>Although I learned to tag XML in 2009, I only used that knowledge to check other writer's work, not to do it on my own.  I only checked them for a year, and haven't "tagged" since!  I definitely consider myself a beginner, but I hope that my linear logic and attention to detail will help me progress quickly!</p>

    	<p> It took me a while to find a good, free, online color palette, but I finally found one I like.
